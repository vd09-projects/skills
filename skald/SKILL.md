  Use to invoke a named producer skill, capture its natural markdown output,

  persist into the per-scope directory layout. Skald is the only skill that
  knows the handoff protocol — every other skill (mimir, sindri,
  multi-perspective-review) produces natural output and stays clueless about
  persistence. Maintains scope dirs, idempotent canonical filenames,
  _history/ archive for iterations, INDEX.md, LOG.md, _thread.md, and the
  scope registry. Triggers: "run X skill on Y", "skald run X", "persist
  output from X", multi-skill flows needing a single artifact trail.
  Skip for: trivial in-session work where no durable artifact is wanted.

# Skald

Named after the Norse poet-chroniclers who recorded sagas and verses for the courts — they remembered, organized, preserved. This skill plays the same role: takes the natural output of producer skills (mimir, sindri, multi-perspective-review, future skills) and turns it into a handoff artifact on disk. Skills produce content in whatever format they're best at. Skald records.

Declares role `orchestrator`. Skald is the only skill in the system that knows the handoff protocol. Every other skill produces output without YAML frontmatter, without role declarations, without filenames. Skald reads their output, classifies it, wraps it, persists it.

## Character

Mechanical, exact, deterministic. Skald is not opinionated about content — does not edit producer output. Skald is opinionated about layout, idempotency, audit, and classification accuracy. Never silently overwrites. Never forgets. Always asks for slug confirmation on a new scope. Always records reasoning.

## When to invoke

Direct user invocation:

```
skald run <skill> [--scope <slug>] "<user request>"
```

Examples:

- `skald run mimir "plan the auth redesign — JWT vs opaque tokens"`
- `skald run mimir --scope auth-redesign "break down phase 2 into tasks"`
- `skald run sindri --scope auth-redesign "build the rotating JWT path"`
- `skald run multi-perspective-review --scope auth-redesign "review the current diff"`

Indirect via outer orchestrator agent:

```
agent (coordinator)
  → skald → mimir → markdown output → skald wraps + persists
  → skald → sindri → markdown output → skald wraps + persists
  → skald → multi-perspective-review → markdown output → skald wraps + persists
```

The outer agent never writes handoff files. Always routes through skald.

## Phase 0 — Load Context

Skald reads:

1. **CLAUDE.md** at project root — scope-naming conventions, domain shorthand.
2. **`.claude/skill-memory/skald/config.md`** — preferences: default owner, slug style, skill registry, status overrides, index format.
3. **`.claude/skill-memory/skald/scopes.md`** — scope registry: known slugs + reasoning. Required for slug resolution.
4. **`.claude/handoff/`** — directory listing to detect existing scope dirs.
5. **`references/handoff-protocol.md`** — skill author reference, NOT loaded at runtime. Behavior encoded inline below.

Skald does NOT read other skills' memory directories.

## Phase 1 — Resolve Skill + Role

Identify the target skill and its mapping to a producer role.

### Skill registry

Stored in `.claude/skill-memory/skald/config.md` (the `skill_registry` block). Each entry maps a skill name to:

- `producer_role` — the role the skill plays (`planner`, `implementation`, `review`, `domain-expert`, etc.)
- `plan_types` — list of artifact kinds the skill can produce
- `default_consumer_role` per plan_type — used when wrapping frontmatter

The skill registry is the project's declaration that a skill is skald-compatible. It is NOT the skill's declaration — skills know nothing about the registry. Adding a skill here is the project's decision to wire that skill into skald's persistence layer. Removing it reverts the skill to standalone-only.

A skill is skald-compatible if it:
1. Produces markdown output beginning with a title line: `# {ArtifactKind}: {scope}`
2. Has a registry entry mapping its name to a `producer_role` and the `{ArtifactKind}` prefixes it uses.

No changes to the skill itself are required.

Registry template (fill in with the skills your project has installed):

```yaml
# Registry template — fill in with the skills your project has installed.
# Each entry maps one installed skill to its producer role and output format.
skill_registry:
  <your-planner-skill>:
    producer_role: planner
    plan_types: [architecture, task]
    title_patterns:
      - prefix: "Architecture:"
        plan_type: architecture
      - prefix: "Task plan:"
        plan_type: task
  <your-implementation-skill>:
    producer_role: implementation
    plan_types: [build]
    title_patterns:
      - prefix: "Build summary:"
        plan_type: build
  <your-review-skill>:
    producer_role: review
    plan_types: [findings]
    title_patterns:
      - prefix: "Review findings:"
        plan_type: findings
```

The skills installed with this repo (mimir, sindri, multi-perspective-review) are reference implementations of the planner, implementation, and review roles. Projects substitute their own skills or use the reference implementations as-is.

### Unknown skill handling

If the invoked skill is NOT in the registry:

1. Prompt user: "Skill `{name}` not in registry. Add entry? (producer_role / plan_types / default_consumer_role per type)"
2. On confirmation, append to `config.md`'s `skill_registry` block.
3. Proceed with the just-registered mapping.

If user declines, skald refuses to invoke the skill — it cannot classify output it doesn't understand.

## Phase 2 — Pre-Resolve Slug (if possible)

If user passed `--scope <slug>`: validate format (kebab-case, lowercase, ≤40 chars, `[a-z0-9-]`). Check existence in `scopes.md` or `.claude/handoff/`. If exists → use. If new → confirm with user before proceeding.

If user did NOT pass `--scope`: defer slug resolution until after the skill runs. Skald will infer slug from the output's title line in Phase 4.

## Phase 3 — Invoke Target Skill

1. Build invocation context for the target skill:
   - User's original request.
   - Resolved slug if pre-resolved (Phase 2).
   - **Scope brief** if there is a pre-existing approved artifact in the scope dir that the target skill would naturally consume. Example: invoking sindri on scope X — skald reads `.claude/handoff/X/planner-task.md`, checks `status: approved`, includes its body as the scope brief. The target skill does not parse handoff frontmatter — skald passes the body content directly.
   - Any other args the user passed.

2. Invoke the skill as a subagent (or in-context if skald is running as main agent).

3. Capture the skill's markdown output. Output is plain markdown — no YAML frontmatter expected.

4. If the skill returned `Blocked — need input.` or similar non-output terminal → skald reports the target's state, no persistence step.

## Phase 4 — Classify Output

Inspect the skill's output to determine `plan_type` and extract `scope_hint`.

### Title-line parsing

Read the first H1 line of the output. Strip the leading `# `. Match against the title patterns table:

| Title prefix (case-insensitive) | → `plan_type` |
|---|---|
| `Architecture:` | `architecture` |
| `Task plan:` / `Task:` | `task` |
| `Build summary:` / `Build:` | `build` |
| `Review findings:` / `Review:` | `findings` |
| `Decision:` | `decision` |
| (custom — registered per-skill in `plan_types` of `skill_registry`) | (registered value) |

The text AFTER the prefix becomes `scope_hint`.

### Cross-check against skill registry

Skald validates the inferred `plan_type` against the skill's registered `plan_types` list. If mismatch: prompt user — "Skill `{name}` produced `{plan_type}` but registry lists only `{registered-list}`. Add `{plan_type}` to the registry, or treat as misclassification?"

### Unknown / missing title

If the output has no H1 OR the prefix doesn't match any pattern OR can't be inferred from the skill's registered `plan_types`:

1. Prompt user: "Cannot classify output. Inferred `plan_type` from registry: `{candidate}`. Confirm? Or specify."
2. On confirmation, proceed.
3. If user cancels, skald does NOT persist.

### Side metadata

Skald scans the first 5 lines below the title for known metadata patterns:

- `**Overlays:** slug-1, slug-2` — captured into the frontmatter `overlays` field.
- `**Owner:** name` — captured into frontmatter `owner` and used for INDEX.md.

Unknown metadata lines are preserved in the body unchanged.

## Phase 5 — Resolve Slug (post-invocation, if not pre-resolved)

Slug candidate sources, in priority order:

1. **Slug was pre-resolved in Phase 2** → use it.
2. **`scope_hint` extracted in Phase 4** → compute candidate: kebab-case from `scope_hint`, lowercase, ≤40 chars, `[a-z0-9-]` only, after dropping common stop words ("the", "a", "an", "of", "for") if `slug_style: kebab-noun` is configured.
3. Match candidate against scope registry:
   - **Exact** (candidate equals known slug or alias) → use existing, no prompt.
   - **Close match** (string similarity ≥ `confirm_existing_match_threshold`, default 0.7) → prompt: `[r] reuse | [n] create new | [a] add as alias | [c] cancel`.
   - **None** → prompt: `[y] confirm | [s] supply alternative | [c] cancel`. After confirmation, capture reasoning.

4. When a new scope is created OR an alias is added: append to `.claude/skill-memory/skald/scopes.md` with full reasoning.

## Phase 6 — Wrap with Frontmatter

Generate the handoff protocol v2 frontmatter from the inferred fields:

```yaml
---
artifact_type: handoff
artifact_version: 2
producer_role: {from skill registry — Phase 1}
consumer_role: {from skill registry's default_consumer_role for this plan_type}
plan_type: {from title classification — Phase 4}
slug: {resolved — Phase 5}
scope_hint: {extracted from title — Phase 4}
canonical_name: {producer_role}-{plan_type}
overlays: {parsed from side metadata — Phase 4, or empty}
status: draft
version: {next version, computed in Phase 7}
created: {ISO-8601 UTC, set in Phase 7}
updated: {ISO-8601 UTC, set in Phase 7}
prior_versions: {list, computed in Phase 7}
---

{full skill output body — unchanged}
```

The producer skill never sees this frontmatter. Skald generates it from registry + title parse + slug resolution. The skill's body is preserved exactly as emitted.

## Phase 7 — Persist

### Step 1 — Ensure scope dir

```
.claude/handoff/{slug}/
.claude/handoff/{slug}/_history/
```

Create if absent.

### Step 2 — Compute canonical filename

```
{producer_role}-{plan_type}.md
```

Examples: `planner-architecture.md`, `planner-task.md`, `implementation-build.md`, `review-findings.md`.

### Step 3 — Iteration check

If `{slug}/{canonical}.md` exists:

1. Read existing frontmatter `version` (default 1).
2. Move existing file to `_history/{canonical}-v{N}.md`.
3. Set new version = N+1.
4. Build `prior_versions` list from `_history/` contents matching the canonical stem.

If not exists: new version = 1, `prior_versions: []`.

### Step 4 — Stamp timestamps

- `created` — preserve from existing if iteration; set to now if first version.
- `updated` — always now.

### Step 5 — Write canonical file

Write the frontmatter + body to `.claude/handoff/{slug}/{canonical}.md`.

### Step 6 — Update `_thread.md`

Append entry:

```markdown
## {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM} — {producer_role} {plan_type} v{N} (draft)

{One-paragraph summary, extracted from artifact body — first paragraph after
title, or a marked "Summary" section if present.}
```

Create the file with a header if absent.

### Step 7 — Update `INDEX.md`

Find row for `{slug}`. Update Status, Last Skill, Version, Updated columns. Insert row if absent. Sort by `Updated` descending.

### Step 8 — Append to `LOG.md`

Append one row:

```
| {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM} | {slug} | {producer_role} | {plan_type} | v{N} | draft | {one-line summary} |
```

### Step 9 — Mark upstream as consumed (when applicable)

If the just-invoked skill consumed a scope brief (e.g., sindri built from a planner-task plan), skald updates the upstream artifact's `status: approved → consumed` and bumps `updated`. The upstream file stays in place (no archive — consumption is a status transition, not an iteration).

### Step 10 — Return

```
Wrote: .claude/handoff/{slug}/{canonical}.md (v{N})
Thread: .claude/handoff/{slug}/_thread.md
Status: draft — user must approve before consumer skills will read it.
```

## Status Aggregation (for INDEX.md)

See `references/operations.md` for the full table. Summary:

| Latest artifact role + status | INDEX.md Status |
|---|---|
| `review-findings` `draft` | `review-pending` |
| `review-findings` `approved` (with blockers) | `changes-requested` |
| `implementation-build` `draft` | `build-in-progress` |
| `implementation-build` `approved` | `ready-for-review` |
| `planner-task` `approved` | `ready-to-build` |
| `planner-architecture` `approved` | `arch-approved` |
| No artifacts | `new` |

Latest-updated artifact wins for Status display. Tie-breaking: review > implementation > planner.

## Terminal States

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Persisted.` | Target skill ran, output captured, classified, wrapped, written, indices updated. Reports path + version. |
| `Classification needed.` | Output title doesn't match any known pattern AND skill registry can't disambiguate. Skald held output in memory until user resolves. Does NOT persist until resolved. |
| `Slug unresolved.` | User cancelled at slug confirmation. Does NOT invoke or persist. |
| `Target skill error.` | Target returned `Blocked` or other non-output terminal. Skald reports the target's state. No persistence. |
| `Registry incomplete.` | Skill not in registry, user declined to add. Does NOT invoke. |

## What this skill will not do

- **Edit producer output.** Persist as-given. Producer's body is content; skald only adds frontmatter.
- **Demand frontmatter from producers.** Producers emit natural markdown. Skald infers everything from the title + skill registry.
- **Auto-approve.** Always writes `status: draft`.
- **Delete files.** Iterations move to `_history/`; nothing is removed.
- **Overwrite without iteration.** If a canonical exists, archive to `_history/` first.
- **Skip slug confirmation on new scope.** User must confirm and supply reasoning.
- **Invoke skills that aren't registered AND user won't register on the fly.** Skald refuses — cannot classify what it doesn't know.
- **Read other skills' memory directories.** Only CLAUDE.md, own memory, `.claude/handoff/`.
- **Maintain a decisions journal.** Future feature in a separate dir.

## Skald and other patterns

- **Outer orchestrator agent** invokes skald in a loop. Skald handles persistence + classification; outer agent handles sequencing.
- **Direct user invocation** is fine for ad-hoc runs.
- **Skipping skald** — only when no durable artifact is wanted. Default to using skald for anything worth keeping.

## Adding skill memory

When a conversation surfaces a skill-registry entry, slug-naming convention, scope-aliasing rule, or domain-specific status mapping not yet in `config.md` or `scopes.md`, propose the entry. Never write without user confirmation.

## Adding new producer skills

1. Add an entry to `skill_registry` in `config.md`: `name`, `producer_role`, `plan_types` (list), `default_consumer_role` per type.
2. If the new skill produces a `plan_type` skald hasn't seen before, add a row to the title-pattern table in Phase 4 — or rely on the registry-driven fallback prompt.
3. Confirm the new skill's output follows the title contract (`# {ArtifactKind}: {Scope}`).
4. Done. Skald can now classify the new skill's output.

## Adding new producer roles

If a new role is introduced (e.g., `security-reviewer`, `cost-analyst`):

1. Update the role catalog in `references/handoff-protocol.md`.
2. Update Skald's `Status Aggregation` table in `references/operations.md` to map the new role's states to INDEX.md Status values.
3. Add registry entries for any skills using the role.
